Steps in Analysing Data

1. Get dimensions and data-types of datasets
2. Univariate Analysis, i.e exploring data with graphs

	a.	visualize the continuous(numeric) variables using histograms and
	b.	categorical variables using bar plots.
	
	eg. sales-count of electronic items (fridge, ac etc) its categorical
		price-range-group of electronic items (1k-5k, 5-10k,10-30k etc) its numeric
	
3. 	Bivariate Analysis to find relation-ship between 2 variables
	
	a. scatter plots for continuous values	
	b. violin plots for categorical values 
		
		
		eg. 

		
4. Missing data adjustments, to predict more efficiently

	a. deleting records of missing items
	b. replace with mean, mode, median values in missing-records
	c. Building Prediction Model: We can even make a predictive model to impute missing data
