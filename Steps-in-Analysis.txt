Steps in Analysing Data

1. Get dimensions and data-types of datasets
2. Univariate Analysis, i.e exploring data with graphs

	a.	visualize the continuous(numeric) variables using histograms and
	b.	categorical variables using bar plots.
	
	eg. sales-count of electronic items (fridge, ac etc) its categorical
		price-range-group of electronic items (1k-5k, 5-10k,10-30k etc) its numeric
	
3. 	Bivariate Analysis to find relation-ship between 2 variables
	
	a. scatter plots for continuous values	
	b. violin plots for categorical values 
		
		
		eg. 

		
4. Missing data adjustments, to predict more efficiently

	a. deleting records of missing items
	b. replace with mean, mode, median values in missing-records
	c. Building Prediction Model: We can even make a predictive model to impute missing data
	
5. Adding additional columns from the given data,
		eg: from the start-year of a store, we can get total years of functioning/
			classify the price-range-groups  on set of products dataset.
			
6.	Machine learning will produce better results on numerical values, rather than categorical values.
	So categorical values can be replaced with 2 types of encodings
	
	a.	Label encoding: 
			simply means converting each category in a variable to a number. It is more suitable for ordinal variables â€” categorical variables with some order.

	b.	One hot encoding:
			each category of a categorical variable is converted into a new binary column (1/0).

7. 	Data Pre-Processing
		pre-processing refers to the transformations applied to your data before feeding it to the algorithm. It invloves further cleaning of data, data transformation, data scaling and many more things.
		
		a.	removing skewness 
		b.	Scaling numeric predictors
		
8. 	Corelation
