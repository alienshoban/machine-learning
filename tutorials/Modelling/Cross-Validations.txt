A few common methods used for cross validation
		The Validation set Approach
		Leave out one cross validation (LOOCV)
		k-fold cross validation
		Stratified k-fold cross validation
		Adversarial validation
		Cross validation for time series
		Custom cross validation techniques
		
		
--------------------------------------------


k-fold Cross Validation
		The steps followed for k-fold CV are as follows:

		1.	Randomly split the data into k”folds”.
		2.	For each k-fold in your dataset, build your model on k – 1 folds of the dataset. Then, test the model to check the effectiveness for kth fold.
		3.	Record the error you see on each of the predictions.
		4.	Repeat this until each of the k-folds has served as the test set
		
		The average of your k recorded errors is called the cross-validation error and will serve as your performance metric for the model.
